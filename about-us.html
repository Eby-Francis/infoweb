            <p>
                Small gardens have a lot more potential than you may realize. Whether dealing with a long narrow space behind a vintage home, a cramped backyard that lacks privacy, or a shabby garden at the rear of a brownstone the possibilities are endless. So don’t write off your 40-foot by 20-foot outdoor area just yet—with the right design, it could be an incredible garden.

            <p>
                Designer Karen Chapman says, "Neither beauty nor function needs to be limited by the size of your outdoor space, but it is important to prioritize your wish list in order to make every square inch count." She offers the following advice, suggestions, and tips:

            <p>
                Entertaining outdoors always seems so much more relaxed, both for the hosts and the guests, but how many people do you need to accommodate? Two for an intimate lunch? Eight for a sit-down dinner? Twelve or more for an informal BBQ?

            <p>
                Are you hoping to grow cut flowers, your favorite herbs, or a few vegetables? When space is limited, it is especially important to determine which of these are worth growing yourself, and which are better to purchase seasonally from your local farmer’s market. Focus on growing flowers and produce that are usually expensive, hard to find, have a short shelf life, or you use regularly.

            <h3 class="busyColor no-padding"><strong>TYPES OF SHADE </strong></h3>
            <p>
                Not all shade is alike. While some plants can survive and thrive in full shade, others need some direct sunlight. The amount of light your yard receives will help determine your choice of plants. Here are three types of shade:

    </p><p>

Partial shade is created by manmade structures including buildings or walls, or natural features such as hillsides that completely block out the sun during part of the day. East-facing areas that receive cooler morning sun are more hospitable to shade plants. West-facing sites are exposed to hot afternoon sun, which can cause foliage burn or other stress.
                
    </p><p>

Dappled shade is most often found underneath a tree canopy, which creates a pattern of sun and shade that moves around throughout the day. The type of tree and size of the canopy will determine the amount of shade.
                
    </p><p>

Full shade refers to an area that receives little or no direct sun. This can occur along the northern side of a home, in a courtyard, between tall urban buildings, or in an area covered by a solid barrier such as a roof overhang or shade cloth.

            </p>
            <br />
            <strong><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;PLANNING A SHADE GARDEN</strong>
            <p>
                Evaluate your site. Observe your yard at different times of the year:
                
    </p><p>

    There is less light in spring and fall due to the lower angle of the sun compared to the longer days of summer.

    </p><p>

    Areas shaded by deciduous trees will receive more light after the leaves have dropped in late fall, until early spring.

    </p><p>

    A shady spot is more prone to standing water since evaporation is slower, so look for areas where water may pool or drain more slowly.
    Microclimates can occur within the same site, affecting air temperature, light, air circulation, and soil.

            <p>
                Since cottage gardens can be small, the look of the surrounding fence is an important decision. Traditional fences were lower than are typical today. Picket fences are popular as are lattice fences which can support flowering vines such as clematis, wisteria, and climbing roses.
                
    </p><p>

The picket fence is the traditional favorite and there are many variations on this theme that you can consider. And remember that you can use any color you want for this fence!
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plant Close/Keep Soil Healthy</strong>
            <p>
                Cottage gardens traditionally have plant beds by the house packed tight with plants. This informal crowding of a wide variety of plants is a signature feature and the mix of perennial and annual flowers with vegetable and foliage plants, twining around each other and competing for attention, is what makes a cottage garden so fascinating. Here I planted Clematis ‘Jackmanii’, climbing up a fence, fronted by Nepeta racemosa ‘Walker’s Low’.
                
    </p><p>

Good, rich organic soil ensures that overflowing plant beds look great—and plants stay healthy—from day one. Make sure to incorporate plenty of compost in the soil and use compost, tea, or fish emulsion fertilizer. Also cover the soil with mulch (not dyed). Mulch is important as it maintains soil moisture, keeps temperatures steady, and improves soil as it breaks down.

                Choose and evaluate your site.
                
    </p><p>

Where would a rock garden look best in your yard? Is the site in sun or shade? Will plants need regular water, or will it be a drought-tolerant landscape? Don’t be afraid to think outside the box. Even a front yard can have a rock garden.

            <br><br><p>
                Make a list.
                
    </p><p>

In order to have the right materials on hand, make a list of what you need.
Source materials.
                
    </p><p>

Peruse local garden centers, home improvement stores and specialty rock suppliers to see and compare materials before buying. For the budget-minded, Craigslist and Freecycle often have listings from people looking to get rid of rock materials. Consider rock quarries or natural areas that allow rockhounding.
Vary the rocks.
                
    </p><p>

To create contrast and visual interest, vary the size and shape of the rocks. Use a mix of materials such as stones, pebbles and gravel.
Placement.
                
    </p><p>

Use a few well-placed larger rocks as primary focal points to anchor the space and install those first. Allow space between the rocks for plants to grow. Smaller complementary stones or gravel placed around the larger rocks will unify the design.
Keep color in mind.
                
    </p><p>

Select larger rocks in lighter hues so the landscape doesn’t feel dark and heavy. Vary the color and tone of other materials to lend contrast and visual interest.
Instill order.
                
    </p><p>

To keep the design from looking too busy, choose rocks with complementary colors and shapes. Lay out swaths of the same pebbles or gravel rather than mixing too many materials together.
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW TO PLANT A ROCK GARDEN</strong>

            <br><br><p>
                Soil matters.
                
    </p><p>

Create an environment that is hospitable to your chosen plants. Alpine plants and other drought-tolerant plants will need sandy soil with sharp drainage. Others, such as ferns and hostas, will need richer soil and more moisture.
Pick the right plants.
                
    </p><p>

Choose plants that will thrive in your climate. Traditional rock gardens include varieties that are alpine in origin, as the conditions simulate their native habitat. Rock garden plants tend to be smaller to complement the scale of the rocks. Use perennials, ornamental grasses and small shrubs to add vertical height. Creeping groundcovers will soften the appearance of the hard rocks. Add sturdy bulbs such as narcissus, wild tulips and alliums for contrast. Incorporate evergreen dwarf and creeping conifers for year-round interest. For a shade garden, choose mosses, ferns and hostas.
Complement and contrast.
                
    </p><p>


To lend cohesion, choose plants with harmonious or complementary colors to the rocks. Use a mix of plants with flowers and foliage interest and combine upright and creeping forms.
